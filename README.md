# Hello, Dev(a)s 👋!

### How are you doing? I hope you and your family are great!

I'm good as well! Thanks for asking!

My name is José Vinicíus, and I'm from Pernambuco in Brazil.

### Working on

By now, I'm working as a Software Engineer at a fintech called Flexpag in Recife.

### Proeficient Technologies

I build applications with JavaScript lately. I'm working a lot with Angular 8+ to build websites as ReactJS and its frameworks (Next.js). I'm taking a lot of features in the backend as well, mainly using Spring Boot, but NodeJS too.

### Studying on

Recently I started to develop some projects using Cloud features like Serverless and Mobile interfaces as well (especially using React Native and Flutter).

### Work

Currently, I'm working at Flexpag that is a Fintech in the, by now, Brazil's Financial Market.
